    When they were dating</h2>
    At the beginning of their relationship, they seemed to get along and be together. 
    Even when they were on group assignments, they were always together.
    Btw, they have 2 friends who always join their group when they have group assignments
<h3>
    Why their relationship ended?
    idk why they relationship needs to end
    even though the two of them did not have serious problems in their relationship
    but I think they have problems in their relationship, but don't want other people to know their problems
    and they relationship need to end.
    <h4>  
Will their relationship ever return to the way it used to be?
Angel's friend, Desi, actually wants their relationship to return
But, Angel is starting to hate Shaquille and I don't know why Angel can hate Shaquille,and throw away her memories with him
